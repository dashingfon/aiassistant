# AI ASSISTANT

This AI assistant is built using Langchain in python and the Cohere large language model(llm).
The model implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation which is an advanced AI model architecture that combines two key components: retrieval and generation.

Retrieval: This part involves a large database of text documents or passages, often called a knowledge base. These documents contain vast amounts of information on various topics. RAG employs advanced algorithms to efficiently search through this knowledge base and retrieve relevant passages based on the input query.

Generation: Once relevant passages are retrieved, the generation component comes into play. This part of the model is responsible for understanding the query and synthesizing a response based on the retrieved information. It utilizes state-of-the-art language generation techniques, often based on transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to produce coherent and contextually relevant answers.

The Document used in this model is a [pdf](/media/Indie%20Bites%209%20PDF.pdf) which contains an interview with the writer Talli L. Morgan and other short fiction stories.

The AI Assistant is context aware and is able to answer questions from the document with accuracy.
